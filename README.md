## pjsoftart: A place for art skill sharing and collaborations

This will be the project where I focus all of my enthusiasm during my 1.8 years of JS programming.
It's also possible that it will be the last JS project before moving to the new language.
It's basically an app that lets you contribute, collaborate, and manage your art projects in-depth.

In this project, I will use:
- [x] next.js
- [x] next-auth
- [x] prisma
- [x] mongodb (can reformat to RDBMS db type)

Also, thanks to everyone who has contributed to any of my projects and if you would like to contribute to this project send me your Github username or contribute directly here.
